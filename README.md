Crash Course Into Python
========================


These ipython notebooks are hosted at https://git.ias.u-psud.fr . If needed, you can find a git tutorial http://githowto.com .

## Summary

These notebooks are meant for you to be able to easily switch to programming in Python. Therefore, you must have some programming skills before starting, ideally in an high-level language like IDL.

## Requisite / Installation

In order to use this notebook, you will need to install first ipython notebook

- http://ipython.org/install.html

And you will also need several python librairies : 

- numpy      : http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html
- matplotlib : http://matplotlib.org/1.3.1/users/installing.html
- astropy    : http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html
- healpy     : https://healpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html

All those packages can be installed using pip like
> pip install --no-deps healpy

or using your favorite package application, for e.g. under Debian you can install them with 

> sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook python-pip python-numpy python-matplotlib python-astropy

Make sure to have the latest version (especially astropy), we will try to keep those notebook updated


You can now clone the notebook with git and use them

> git clone https://git.ias.u-psud.fr/abeelen/python-notebook.git

> cd python-notebook

> ipython notebook
